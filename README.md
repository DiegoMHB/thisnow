This web app is designed for both mobile and desktop platforms, offering a seamless experience for users to quickly post urgent needs or offers. Using geolocation, the app allows you to create a post and place it on a map. Each post includes a keyword, which will be the main visible element on the map, giving others a quick idea of what is being requested or offered in the area.

The app is intended for short-term, immediate exchanges, as each post remains visible for only a few hours. It's perfect for urgent tasks like borrowing something, offering a ride, or even requesting last-minute help. Users can upload photos with their posts to add more detail, making it easier for others to understand the context.

To enhance the user experience, the app incorporates a color-coding system to categorize different types of posts, such as requests (in red) or offers (in green). Additionally, the app features powerful filters, allowing users to sort posts by categories, urgency, or location, and even track trending posts based on demand.

Whether you're in a rush to find something or offer immediate help, this app connects people locally with speed and efficiency.
